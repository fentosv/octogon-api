## GraphQL API

In addition to our REST endpoints, we offer a GraphQL API for more flexible and efficient data querying. GraphQL allows you to request exactly the data you need in a single query, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching of data.

### GraphQL Endpoint

```
POST https://api.octagon-api.com/graphql
```

### Schema Overview

Our GraphQL schema includes the following main types:

- `Query`: The entry point for all GraphQL queries
- `Division`: Represents a weight division
- `Fighter`: Represents a fighter
- `Champion`: Represents a champion of a division

### Example Queries

1. Get all rankings with champions and fighters:

```graphql
query {
  rankings {
    id
    categoryName
    champion {
      id
      championName
    }
    fighters {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

2. Get detailed information about a specific fighter:

```graphql
query {
  fighter(id: "jon-jones") {
    name
    nickname
    category
    wins
    losses
    draws
    status
    age
    height
    weight
    reach
    legReach
  }
}
```

3. Get information about a specific division:

```graphql
query {
  division(id: "flyweight") {
    categoryName
    champion {
      championName
    }
    fighters {
      name
      wins
      losses
    }
  }
}
```

### Using GraphQL in Your Application

To use our GraphQL API:

1. Send a POST request to `https://api.octagon-api.com/graphql`
2. Set the `Content-Type` header to `application/json`
3. In the request body, include a JSON object with a `query` key containing your GraphQL query

Example using curl:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "{ fighter(id: \"jon-jones\") { name category wins losses } }"}' \
  https://api.octagon-api.com/graphql
```

### Benefits of Using GraphQL

- **Flexible Queries**: Request multiple resources in a single query
- **Precise Data Fetching**: Get only the data you need, nothing more, nothing less
- **Strongly Typed**: The schema provides clear expectations about the structure of the data
- **Introspection**: Explore the available data and schema using GraphQL introspection

### GraphQL Playground

For interactive exploration of our GraphQL API, you can use the GraphQL Playground available at:

```
https://api.octagon-api.com/graphql
```

This web-based tool allows you to write and execute queries, explore the schema, and view documentation.

For more information on how to use GraphQL, please refer to the [official GraphQL documentation](https://graphql.org/learn/).
